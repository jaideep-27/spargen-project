## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up Swarnika locally for development or exploration, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16.x or later recommended)
*   npm (v8.x or later) or yarn
*   MongoDB (ensure a local instance is running or have a connection URI ready)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spargen-project.git
    cd spargen-project
    ```
    *(Please replace `https://github.com/your-username/spargen-project.git` with your actual repository URL.)*

2.  **Server-Side Setup:**
    Navigate to the server directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install 
    # or yarn install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying `server/.env.example` (if one exists) or by creating it manually. Populate it with your specific configurations:
    ```env
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5001 # Or your preferred backend port
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
    JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_and_secret_jwt_key
    # Add any other backend-specific environment variables (e.g., payment gateway API keys)
    ```

3.  **Client-Side Setup:**
    Navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
    If the client requires specific environment variables (e.g., the API URL if not proxied), create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001 # Adjust if your server port is different
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `server` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    # (or the script specified in your server/package.json, e.g., npm start)
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    From the `client` directory (in a new terminal window):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The Swarnika application should now be accessible, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
